# React set up with tailwind

So I can save a few extra seconds which I can then invest in doing nothing




## Set up


Clone from git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devan-MEC/ReactV18PlusTailwind.git
```
Change directory into the cloned folder
```
cd ReactV18PlusTailwind
```
To get npm modules
```
npm install
```

## Removing Git Upstreams ( optional )
To see upstreams
```
git remote
```

To remove upstreams
```
git remote remove [upstream_name]
```

## Starting the project
Inside the cloned directory
```
npm run start
```
If you see the text 'Hello World!' underlined, you're good to go!
